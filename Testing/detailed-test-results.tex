\subsection{Overview of Test Results}

Most unit tested conducted thus far are for the back-end server, four unit tests were conducted for each the Earthquakes and Fires disasters and one for the weather. Mocha.js was the testing framework of choice used on the back-end server due to ease of testing nodejs applications, Chai was used as an assertion library due to to it delightfulness in pairing with any javascript testing framework i.e. Mocha.js. Such testing framework assisted for running automated unit tests
