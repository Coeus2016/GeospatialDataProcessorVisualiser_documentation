\subsection{Test Case 1: Query All Earthquakes}
\subsubsection{Condition 1: the back-end server must be running}
\subsubsection{Condition 2: the correct route must be called (/earthquakes)}
\subsubsection{Objective:} The purpose of this test is to validate whether all earthquakes data residing on the database is returned  as a json object
\subsubsection{Input}
\subsubsection{Outcome}

\subsection{Test Case 2: Time Query - In between Earthquakes}

\subsubsection{Condition 1: the back-end server must be running}
