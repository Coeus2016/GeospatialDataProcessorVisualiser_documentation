\subsection{Purpose}	

Software testing forms an integral part of software design, intended to empirically verify whether the software being developed conforms to specifications. Unit testing test a piece of code in isolation against requirements and when done constructively it contributes to code flexibility and and reusability. Black-box testing was used as the tests were developed to contract specification. Test-driven devolopment(TTD) approach was followed during the project as it forms part of the agile development technique.

The benefits of unit testing include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[1]Reduced system failure risk.
	
	\item[2]Rapid feedback on developed components.
	
	\item[3]Reduced cost due to
	\begin{itemize}
		\item less time spent on bug fixes
		\item reduced integration problems, and 
		\item lower manual testing costs
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item[4]Improved Maintainability due to unit testing
	
	\item[5]Improved Reusability leading to less code being developed and maintained
\end{enumerate}
