Technologies and frameworks that will be used to build the system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Front-end
\begin{itemize}
	\item AngularJS, provide good supports RESTFul services and easy integration with other technologies.
	\item RabbitMQ listener as Message bus, to collect real time data from the backend feeder.
	\item Leaflet.js, as our map framework that will use the openStreetMap as its map source.
\end{itemize}
\item Back-end
\begin{itemize}
	\item NodeJS for server-side Web applications.
	\item ExpressJS is a framework for on node.js for building web-application, supports RESTful services.
	\item Bluebird for promises, to complete asynchoneous tasks.
	\item RabbitMQ feeder as Message bus, to collect real time data from the database.
\end{itemize}
\item Database
\begin{itemize}
	\item RethinkDB, supports "changefeeds", which allow you to subscribe to changes on a table. This goes hand in hand with the real-time feature of the system
	\item RabbitMQ, a framework for RethinkDB; is a natural choice for distributing notifications of change events on RethinkDB.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
