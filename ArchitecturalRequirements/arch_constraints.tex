The choice of architecture components and technologies is mostly unconstrained. The development team may choose the architecture and technologies best suited to fulfil the non-functional requirements for the system subject to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the system must be deployable in a Docker container, and
	\item the system must use only open source frameworks and tools.
\end{enumerate}
