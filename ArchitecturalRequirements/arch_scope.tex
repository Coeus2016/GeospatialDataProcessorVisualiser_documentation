The architectural responsibilities that need to be addressed by the software architecture are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A website that users will interact with to view weather and disasters occurring throughout the world
	\item A database that will be used to persist large amounts of real-time data as well user's detailsand preferences
	\item A web server that will allow for interfacing with the website and processing of requests
	\item An api server that will be used to collect data from various data sources and persist them to a database
	\item A persistence API that will allow for messages from the database to be accessed then queued
	
\end{itemize}
