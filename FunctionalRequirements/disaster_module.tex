\subsubsection{addDisasterType}

Adding a disaster type requires that the user has admin rights and that there should not be a disaster type of the type being added that exists. If the user is admin and the disaster type being added is unique then a new disaster type will be added to the system. Below are the service contract, activity diagram and functional requirements diagram for addDisasterType.

\subsubsection{modifyDisasterType}

Modifying a disaster type requires that the user has admin rights and that there should not be a disaster type of the same type as the modified one. If the user is admin and the modified disaster type is unique then the modified disaster type will be persisted to the database.
