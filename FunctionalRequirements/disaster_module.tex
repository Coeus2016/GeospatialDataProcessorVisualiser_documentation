\subsubsection{queryDisaster}

A user, given that they are logged in, will be able to query the system for specific disasters, by entering search criteria such as a date, location or a disaster feature like magnitude level for earthquakes. That way only disasters matching the specified criteria are returned to the user. Below are the service contract, activity diagram and functional requirements diagram for queryDisaster.

\subsubsection{notifyNewDisaster}

A user, given that they are logged in, will be able to be notified of any new disasters that are occuring as of the time they are using the system as long as that disaster is not visualized on the system yet. Below are the service contract, activity diagram and functional requirements diagram for notifyNewDisaster.

\subsubsection{trackDisaster}

A user, given that they are logged in, is able to track a disaster as long as the disaster is still active and data for the disaster is updated regurlarly. Below are the service contract, activity diagram and functional requirements diagram for trackDisaster.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{addDisasterType}

Adding a disaster type requires that the user has admin rights and that there should not be a disaster type of the type being added that exists. If the user is admin and the disaster type being added is unique then a new disaster type will be added to the system. Below are the service contract, activity diagram and functional requirements diagram for addDisasterType.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{modifyDisasterType}

Modifying a disaster type requires that the user has admin rights and that there should not be a disaster type of the same type as the modified one. If the user is admin and the modified disaster type is unique then the modified disaster type will be persisted to the database. Below are the service contract, activity diagram and functional requirements diagram for modifiyDisasterType.
