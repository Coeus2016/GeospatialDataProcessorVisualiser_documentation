The system use cases are characterised as follows:
 \begin{itemize}

 	\item \textbf{Manage Disaster - Critical}\\ This use case is critical since the main functionality of the system requires disaster management.
 	\item \textbf{Manage Disaster Types - Important}\\ An authorized user should be able to add a new disaster type or remove a redundant disaster type.
	\item \textbf{Track Disaster - Important}\\ Users need to be able to track an active disaster that has occurred for feedback purposes. 
 	\item \textbf{Notify New Disaster - Important}\\ A user that is currently online should be able to get instantaneous notification of a newly occurring disaster.
 	\item \textbf{Manage Climate - Important}\\ A user should be able to view normal weather climate at any time they wish to.
 	\item \textbf{Manage User - Important} \\ A user should be able to register with the system because as a registered user, once logged into the system they would be able to change their profiles or manage their weather and disaster preferences as well as log out of the system once done. A user who has forgotten their password is able to have it sent to them via email. An authorized user (admin) once logged in is able to access and/or modify relevant system data.
	\item \textbf{Manage Preferences - Important} \\ A registered user should be able to add, edit or view their weather and disaster preferences.
