The system use cases are characterised as follows:
 \begin{itemize}

 	\item \textbf{Manage Disaster - Critical}\\ This use case is critical since the main functionality of the system requires disaster management.
 	\item \textbf{Track Disaster - Important}\\ Users need to be able to track a disaster that has occurred for feedback purposes. 
 	\item \textbf{Manage Disaster Types - Important}\\ An authorized user should be able to add a new disaster type or remove a redundant disaster type.
 	\item \textbf{Notify New Disaster - Important}\\ A user should be able to get instantaneous notification of a newly occurring disaster.
 	\item \textbf{Manage Climate - Important}\\ A user should be able to view normal weather climate at any time they wish to.
 	\item \textbf{Manage User - Important} \\ A user needs to be able to register with the system because as a registered user, once logged into the system they would be able to manage their weather and disaster preferences as well as log out of the system once done. An authorized user (admin) once logged in is able to access and/or modify relevant system data.
	\item \textbf{Manage Preferences - Important} \\ A registered user should be able to add, edit or view their weather and disaster preferences.
