The aim of this project is to provide a fully functional system to facilitate the processing and visualisation of geospatial data in real-time\footnote[1]{real-time}, including but not limited to climate and fire disasters. The system should be maintainable, with detailed supporting documentation for the Real-time Geospatial Data Processor and Visualiser system. When implemented, the system should be able to store, process and visualise large amounts of data in real-time.
