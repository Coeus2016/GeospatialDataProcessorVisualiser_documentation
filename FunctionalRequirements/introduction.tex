The purpose of this document is to outline the core functionality of the Real-time Geospatial Data Processor and Visualiser system in a technology neutral design specification. The design is not necessarily a depiction of what the final system will look like as during the development of the system it is possible that new functionalities are added, or old ones removed. \linebreak \linebreak
In this document we will thoroughly discuss and layout the project's functional requirements to provide a clear overview of the system as a whole. An agile approach is being followed which
involves an interactive and incremental method of managing and designing the system as described by the scrum methodology.
